DokuWiki FUSE Driver (python)

using (slightly enhanced) dokuwikixmlrpc.py 
from http://github.com/chimeric/dokuwikixmlrpc

use it with care in production environments

rejects to write filenames with dokuwiki-unclean id's,
eg:
  - .test.swp
  - öägaga
  - everything except:
    * ^[a-z0-9]{1}[a-z0-9\.]*$

its really slow!
